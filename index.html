            Hello internet, and welcome to my little blog site! If you have found this,
            it is a small place for me to share what I know about coding, details about
            my various projects, as well as updates about my journey in learning software
            development (and other similar careers, such as data science). Please feel
            free to have a look around, and use the navigation bar at the top of the page
            to access the other main webpages.
